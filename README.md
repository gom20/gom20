## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gom20
Throughout my seven years as a software engineer for Samsung SDS, I worked on various projects such as developing Smart TV web applications, web servers, and maintaining the semiconductor manufacturing system. My job on this last project was to run a system that analyzed the amount of material used in the semiconductor production process, where I mainly monitored the system and modified server code. When there were user requests, I wrote SQL queries and extracted data accordingly. It was a good opportunity to deal with a large amount of data based on the Oracle Exadata database.
